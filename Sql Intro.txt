SQL Server is the database engine where we create and maintain Databases
We create tables inside the DB
Data are stored inside the tables
SQL Server Management Studio - User Interface to connect to different SQL Servers

Server/System refers to our own laptop or a desktop where we install SQL Server
Versions - 2008, 2008R2, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019
Instance is one version of SQL Server
Each instance is independent of each other
When you install 2017 SQL Server on a machine that already has 2017, it will try to repair it
Each instance will be corresponding to different versions of SQL Server

We can assign names to our instances of SQL Server. There are two types of instances :
	Default Instance : When we do not assign any name. There can be only one default instance per system.
	When trying to connect to the default instance :  You can connect using the Server Name(System name) itself
	Named Instance : Instances that have a name attached. All the instances can be named instances(all different names).
	When trying to connect to the named instance : You can connect using the SystemName\InstanceName

Services.msc gives you the list of installed services on your machine

SQL Server Service will validate if it is an authentic request
- If yes, then it allows access
- If no, then it rejects request

SQL Server service is the most important service in the context of MS SQL Server. This is called the heart of SQL Server.
Each instance of SQL Server has its own SQL Server service.
SQL Server service is an universal listener, which listens to the connection requests from different sources.
The SQL Server service start up type should be automatic and the status should be Running
